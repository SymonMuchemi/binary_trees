# Binary Trees

This project aims to provide an understanding of binary trees and their various concepts. Below are the key concepts covered in this project:

## What is a Binary Tree?

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Difference between a Binary Tree and a Binary Search Tree

A binary tree is a general tree structure, whereas a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree that follows a specific ordering property. In a BST, the left child of a node contains a value smaller than the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value.

## Time Complexity Gain compared to Linked Lists

Binary trees offer a significant time complexity gain compared to linked lists for certain operations. While linked lists have a linear time complexity for searching, inserting, and deleting elements, binary trees provide logarithmic time complexity for these operations, making them more efficient.

## Depth, Height, and Size of a Binary Tree

- Depth: The depth of a node in a binary tree is the number of edges from the root node to that node.
- Height: The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth among all nodes in the tree.
- Size: The size of a binary tree is the total number of nodes in the tree.

## Traversal Methods for Binary Trees

There are several traversal methods to go through a binary tree:

- Inorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Preorder Traversal: Visit the root, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder Traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

## Complete, Full, Perfect, and Balanced Binary Trees

- Complete Binary Tree: A binary tree is complete if all levels except the last level are completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
- Full Binary Tree: A binary tree is full if every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- Perfect Binary Tree: A binary tree is perfect if all its levels are completely filled.
- Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one.
